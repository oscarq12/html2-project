				<h2> This is my about me for class! Enjoy!</h2>
			</header>
			<p>
				I'm 27 years old, I am from Houston, TX. I served as an active duty US Marine for 5 years now currently in the reserves, I'm married with no kids. I currently work as an online coach and trainer. I love taking very long drives and I have a love for watches of all styles. I lived about 5 and a half years on the west coast on Camp Pendleton, CA. My wife is my inspiration to do all things great so we have the life we dream of! I'm a big fan of cats, I own 2, Loki and Luna. Oh, and I compete, I have done 6 competitions, no pro card yet. I look forward to learning in this class and knowing all of you!
